1. Continuous Integration Workflow – ci.yml

Purpose:
Automatically checks code quality whenever a developer pushes changes to the main branch.
It ensures dependencies are installed, the code builds correctly, and linting passes before merging.

Configuration Summary:

Triggers: On every push or pull request to the main branch.

Environment: Ubuntu latest.

Main Steps:

Checkout the repository

Install dependencies (npm install)

Run linting (and later, tests if added)

How to Interpret Results:

Green check: Build and lint successful.

Red cross: There’s a code or dependency issue.
Check the Actions → Continuous Integration → Logs section to see which step failed.

2. Deployment Pipeline Workflow – deploy.yml

Purpose:
Automates the deployment process of the web application after code changes are pushed.
This ensures continuous delivery and keeps the app up to date automatically.

Configuration Summary:

Triggers: On every push to the main branch.

Environment: Ubuntu latest.

Main Steps:

Checkout the repository

Install dependencies (npm ci)

Build the app (if applicable)

Deploy to a hosting platform (e.g., GitHub Pages, Heroku, or AWS)

How to Interpret Results:

Success: Deployment completed; website updated.

Failure: Check “Deploy” step in logs for missing scripts or authentication errors.

3. Scheduled Tasks Workflow – scheduled-tasks.yml

Purpose:
Runs maintenance or background tasks automatically at a set schedule (for example, daily or weekly).
Used for automated backups, cleaning temporary files, or refreshing data.

Configuration Summary:

Triggers: On a schedule using cron syntax (for example, 0 0 * * * for every midnight).

Main Steps:

Checkout the repository

Install dependencies

Run custom maintenance commands (like echo "Scheduled task running...")

How to Interpret Results:

Success: Scheduled task ran properly.

You can view when it last ran in Actions → Scheduled Tasks.

4. Dependency Updates Workflow – dependency-updates.yml

Purpose:
Keeps all npm dependencies up to date automatically using Dependabot or npm commands.
Prevents security issues and outdated libraries.

Configuration Summary:

Triggers:

On a schedule (weekly)

Or manually (on workflow dispatch)

Main Steps:

Checkout the repository

Run npm outdated to check for new versions

Automatically create a pull request with updated dependencies

How to Interpret Results:

Success: Dependency check passed or pull request created.

Failure: Missing package.json or version conflicts.
Logs show which dependencies are outdated.

5. Code Review Workflow – code-review.yml

Purpose:
Enhances pull requests by automatically checking code style, linting errors, and scanning for security issues.
It helps reviewers identify issues before merging.

Configuration Summary:

Triggers: On pull requests to the main branch.

Main Steps:

Checkout the repository

Install dependencies

Run npm run lint or static analysis tools

Report results back to the pull request

How to Interpret Results:

Pass: Code meets style and security standards.

Fail: Linting or vulnerability issue found.
The pull request will show “checks failed” until issues are fixed.

6. Documentation Deployment Workflow – documentation.yml

Purpose:
Automatically builds and deploys the project documentation to GitHub Pages whenever changes are made in the docs folder.

Configuration Summary:

Triggers:

On push to the main branch

When files under docs/** are modified

Main Steps:

Checkout the repository

Build documentation using npm install (if documentation generator is used)

Deploy using peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3

How to Interpret Results:

Success: Documentation deployed to GitHub Pages.

Failure: Missing docs:build script or missing build folder.

7. Custom Workflow Integration – release-notes.yml

Purpose:
Automatically generates release notes whenever a new version tag (for example, v1.0.0) is pushed.
Helps maintain a clear changelog without manual updates.

Configuration Summary:

Triggers: On push with tags that match v*.*.* (for example, v1.0.0).

Main Steps:

Checkout the repository

Run changelog generator (npx auto-changelog -p)

Commit or upload generated notes

How to Interpret Results:

Success: Changelog generated successfully.

Check under Actions → Generate Release Notes for the new changelog output.
